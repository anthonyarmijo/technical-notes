And today, I discovered Obsidian themes...

Windows 98 edition! :P

I didn't realize that browsing themes would be so entertaining, especially after wasting about an hour browsing jobs on indeed. Speaking of which, the job hunt is not turning out so great.  For the last 10 months, I've been working for a small group under the DoD, within the Navy. It was a great opportunity to get myself into a proper SysAdmin role and get to touch some nice things (AWS, Citrix, GPO), but they are decomissing my poor "SkyDesk" (ugh, I hate DoD terminology). SkyDesk is just the name given to our Citrix VDI service, as we will those managed desktops to Navy customers for a monthly fee. I only have about 40 customers total though, so its obviously a very niche community (classified projects only).

My project core advised that I will be supporting the systems until at the latest, Feburary of next year. After that... well it's a little unclear, but it sounds like I may be out of a job unless I get picked up in another project.

While writing this, I'm realizing I should stop browsing jobs and start getting my skills up! Linux is a top priority, then I'm thinking I should dive into Infrastructure as a Code - but we'll see.

So much to learn, so little time...

P.S. I just wanted to share that I started playing the guitar this year, and lovin' it!
