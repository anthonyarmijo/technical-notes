Today is an interesting day. For one reason or another, I decided that I was not thoroughly satisified with my current digital notetaking techniques. I started reading up on Linux after having a brief thought on using a \*nix based operating system as my daily driver. An operating system (OS), although not the same as a notetaking app, led me down a rabbit hole of introspection on how an OS is simply a #tool. No more, and no less. 

Unlike the cult-like OS-praising mentalities that have existed, (and as extreme as some religious groups!), there is no need to limit your work to a single digital tool due to a lack of open-mindedness. **A tool should be just that, a device that enables you to perform the "real work"**. The key is to find your purpose or task, then use the tool that best fulfills that specific task. *There is no such thing as one tool that is best for every task.

A notetaking app should be the same. I've used Notion, Apple Notes, Evernote, Bear, and others, only to find that they didn't fully resonate with me and fulfill my need. Most of the time, I would have a clutter of folders and excessive hiearchy, only to never re-visit the notes within, as they collect notional dust on their digital shelves.

I started thinking, if one is to use a notetaking app as a proper tool, shouldn't it reflect the way in which our brain works? I'm no neuroligist, but I understand that humans learn by creating connections in the mind. Sometimes they can be abstract; for example, creating a link or relationship between a color and a past experience.

**Obsidian.md** works just like this - a canvas, based on markdown files, that allows you to create links and tags within your notes, connecting them to relevant thoughts or references within the same system. This allows you to see your notes as a "second brain", where you can actually see the non-linear connections in digital space.

This topic could go on... but we'll save that for another day. The last thing I wanted to note was that I discovered a popular note taking method often used with Obsidian called the [Zettelkasten Method](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/). I'm not entirely familiar with it, but It will be on the to-do list of things to reserach/learn ;)

Obsidian.md looks promising, but I still need to find out if it is the right tool for me. Let's try it out and see how this little experiment goes...
