# Methods
Methods, just like in PowerShell, are types of actions that can be performed on a piece of data.

For example,
```py
name = 'ada_lovelace'
print(name.title())
```
You can see above that we call the `title()` method using a `.` on the `name` variable. This particular method converts the variable string to use **title case** (e.g. `Ada_Lovelace`)

Some other methods include:
```py
name.upper() #changes the variable (name) to uppercase
name.lower() #changes the variable (name) to lowercase
```

## Chaining Methods
- Note that you can chain multiple methods in a single line of code:
```py
name = input("What's your name?").strip().title()
```

# F-Strings
```py
first_name = "ada"
last_name = "lovelace"
full_name = f"{first_name} {last_name}"
print(full_name)
```

You can use f-strings to reference variables within a string. Simply place the letter f immediately before the opening quotation mark. Then you can use curly braces to reference the variable.

```py
print(f"Hello, {full_name.title()}!")
```

This prints an f-string and calls the 'title' method on our full_name variable in order to provide title case for the stored name within our string.

# Whitespace
## Add Whitespace
You can add whitespace into code by adding these character combinations into strings:
`\t` - Add a tab to your string 
`\n` - Add a newline to your string

```py
print("\tPython") #adds a tab to a string
	Python

print("Languages:\n\tPython\n\tC\n\tJavaScript") #combine tab + indent
Languages:
	Python
	C
	JavaScript
```
## Remove Whitespace
Same idea as above, but different methods:
```py
favorite_language = 'python '
favorite_language.rstrip()
'python'

# ensure the variable strips the whitespace permanently:
favorite_language = favorite_language.rstrip()

# strip both sides:
favorite_language = ' python '
favorite_language.strip
'python'
```

# Misc
## split() method
- You can split strings into mutliple variables:
```py
name = ("Anthony Armijo")
first, last = name.split(" ")
# whatever is in the split method is the character that Python will look for to split the sring, in this case a single space.
```
## removeprefix() method
- This method allows you to remove a specific part of **the beginning** of a string.
```py
my_url = 'https://google.com'
my_url.removeprefix('https://')
'google.com'

# makes change permanent with a new variable:
my_short_url = my_url.removeprefix('https://')
```

## Syntax Errors
#### Double Quotes
```py
# python has no issues if the apostrophe is contained in double quotes.
message = "One of Python's strengths is its diverse community."
print(message)

# You cannot use a single quote within a string since it will confuse the Python enterpreter.
message = 'One of Python's strengths is its diverse community.''
print(message)

# To avoid these syntax errors, you can use the escape character (\) as to exclude certain punctuation from the python interpreting logic.
print("Albert Einstein once said, \"A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.\"")
```
