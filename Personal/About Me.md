My name is Anthony – A few things about me,

-   I am a motorcycle enthusiast
-   I love the great outdoors, rain or shine.
-   I am a technology aficionado

Just like life has a beating pulse, technology pulses similarly. Fiber optic lanes are the arteries of our global infrastructure – living and breathing. The internet has enabled an era of communication never known before to humanity – and it is to become not only an extension, but a reflection of the human experience.

I can only imagine what is to come, and hope to be a part of it.

This blog will serve as a space where I can document some of what I learn, share my thoughts. and track my progress as I progress as a professional technologist.
